When powering on the module, the command AT+IPR can be sent by the MCU to configure the communication baud rate afterwards. 1.1. Definitions • <CR> Carriage return character. • <LF> Line feed character. • <...> Parameter name. Angle brackets do not appear on the command line. • [...] Optional parameter of a command or an optional part of TA information response. Square brackets do not appear on the command line. When an optional parameter is not given in a command, the new value equals to its previous value or the default settings, unless otherwise specified. • Underline Default setting of a parameter. 1.2. AT Command Syntax All command lines must start with AT or at and end with <CR>. Information responses and result codes always start and end with a carriage return character and a line feed character: <CR><LF><response><CR><LF>. In tables presenting commands and responses throughout this document, only the commands and responses are presented, and <CR> and <LF> are deliberately omitted. AT commands implemented by BC65 and BC95-GR fall into two categories syntactically: “Basic”, and “Extended”, as listed below: BC65&BC95-GR_AT_Commands_Manual 7 / 101 -IoT Module Series -IoT Module Series • Basic Command These AT commands have the format of AT<x><n>, or AT&<x><n>, where <x> is the command, and <n> is/are the argument(s) for that command. An example of this is ATE<n>, which tells the DCE (Data Circuit-terminating Equipment) whether received characters should be echoed back to the DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) according to the value of <n>. <n> is optional and a default will be used if it is omitted. • Extended Command These commands can be operated in several modes, as following table: Table 1: Types of AT Commands Command Type Syntax Description Test Command AT+<cmd>=? Test the existence of corresponding command and return information about the type, value, or range of its parameter. Read Command AT+<cmd>? Check the current parameter corresponding command. value of a Write Command AT+<cmd>=<p1>[,<p2>[,<p3>[...]]] Set user-definable parameter value. Execution Command AT+<cmd> Return a specific information parameter or perform a specific action. Multiple commands can be placed on a single line using a semi-colon (;) between commands. In such cases, only the first command should have AT prefix. Commands can be in upper or lower case. Spaces should be ignored when you enter AT commands, except in the following cases: • Within quoted strings, where spaces are preserved; • Within an unquoted string or numeric parameter; • Within an IP address; • Within the AT command name up to and including a =, ? or =?. On input, at least a carriage return is required. A newline character is ignored so it is permissible to use carriage return/line feed pairs on the input. If no command is entered after the AT token, OK will be returned. If an invalid command is entered, ERROR will be returned. Optional parameters, unless explicitly stated, need to be provided up to the last parameter being entered. BC65&BC95-GR_AT_Commands_Manual 8 / 101 -IoT Module Series -IoT Module Series 1.3. AT Command Responses When the AT command processor has finished processing a line, it will output OK, ERROR or +CME ERROR: <err> to indicate that it is ready to accept a new command. Solicited information responses are sent before the final OK, ERROR or +CME ERROR: <err>. Responses will be in the format of: <CR><LF>+CMD1:<parameters><CR><LF> <CR><LF>OK<CR><LF> Or <CR><LF><parameters><CR><LF> <CR><LF>OK<CR><LF> 1.4. Declaration of AT Command Examples The AT command examples in this document are provided to help you learn about how to use the AT commands introduced herein. The examples, however, should not be taken as Quectel’s recommendation or suggestions about how you should design a program flow or what status you should set the module into. Sometimes multiple examples may be provided for one AT command. However, this does not mean that there exists a correlation among these examples and that they should be executed in a given sequence. 1.5. 3GPP Compliance 3GPP commands are compliant with the 3GPP TS 27.007, 3GPP TS 27.005 and ITU V.250 specifications. BC65&BC95-GR_AT_Commands_Manual 9 / 101 -IoT Module Series -IoT Module Series 2 General Commands 2.1.

AT+CGACT PDP Context Activation/Deactivation This Write Command activates or deactivates the specified PDP context(s). After the command is completed, the MT remains in V.250 command state. If any PDP context is already in the requested state, the state for that context remains unchanged. If the requested state for any specified context cannot be achieved, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned. Extended error responses are enabled by the AT+CMEE command. If the UE is not PS attached when the activation form of the command is executed, the UE first performs a PS attach and then attempts to activate the specified contexts. If the attach fails then the MT responds with an error or, if extended error responses are enabled, with the appropriate failure-to-attach error message. Note that in the 3GPP TS 27.007 specification there is the following statement: For EPS, if an attempt is made to disconnect the last PDN connection, then the UE responds with ERROR or, if extended error responses are enabled, a +CME ERROR. For EPS, the activation request for an EPS bearer resource will be answered by the network by either an EPS dedicated bearer activation or EPS bearer modification request. The request must be accepted by the UE before the PDP context can be set into established state. If no <cid> is specified, the activation form of the command activates all defined non-emergency contexts, and the deactivation form of the command deactivates all active contexts. This Read Command returns the current activation states for all the defined PDP contexts. This Test Command requests information on the supported PDP context activation states. BC65&BC95-GR_AT_Commands_Manual 39 / 101 -IoT Module Series -IoT Module Series AT+CGACT PDP Context Activation/Deactivation Test Command AT+CGACT=? Response +CGACT: (list of supported <state>s) OK Read Command AT+CGACT? Response +CGACT: <cid>,<state> [+CGACT: <cid>,<state> […]] OK Write Command AT+CGACT=<state>[,<cid>[,<cid>[,...]]] Response If context is activated successfully: OK If context is deactivated successfully: OK If there is any error, response: ERROR Or +CME ERROR: <err> Maximum Response Time 150 s, determined by network. Characteristics / Parameter <state> Integer type.

AT+COPS Operator Selection This Write command forces an attempt to select and register the EPS network operator using the USIM card installed in the currently selected card slot. <mode> is used to select whether the selection is done automatically by the MT or is forced by this command to operator <oper> (it shall be given in format <format>) to a certain access technology, indicated in <AcT>. If the selected operator is not available, no other operator shall be selected (except <mode>=4). If the selected access technology is not available, then the same operator shall be selected in other access technology. The selected operator name format shall also apply to further read commands (AT+COPS?). <mode>=2 forces an attempt to deregister from the network. The selected mode affects all further network registration (e.g. after <mode>=2, MT shall be unregistered until <mode>=0 or 1 is selected). This command should be abortable when registration/deregistration attempt is made. This Read Command returns the current mode, the currently selected operator and the current access technology. If no operator is selected, <format>, <oper> and <AcT> are omitted. This Test Command returns a set of five parameters, each representing an operator present in the network. A set consists of an integer indicating the availability of the operator <stat>, long and short alphanumeric format of the operator’s name, numeric format representation of the operator and access technology. Any of the formats may be unavailable and should then be an empty field. The list of operators shall be in the order of: home network, networks referenced in USIM or active application in the UICC (USIM) in the following order: HPLMN selector, user controlled PLMN selector, operator controlled PLMN selector and PLMN selector (in the USIM), and other networks. BC65&BC95-GR_AT_Commands_Manual 46 / 101 -IoT Module Series -IoT Module Series The <AcT> access technology selected parameters should only be used in terminals capable of registering to more than one access technology.

Therefore, when executing AT+QSCLK=1, please make sure the UART has been waken up first before sending an AT command. 2. When AT+QSCLK=0, UART is always working. If it is intended to make the module enter sleep mode, please resend AT+QSCLK=1 or 2. 3. Switching between <n>=1 and <n>=2 requires a rebooting to take effect. 4. The BC65 module is waked up from deep sleep by driving PSM_EINT pin low, and the BC95-GR module is waked up from deep sleep by MCU sending an AT command to the module (this command will be discarded and not be printed in UART). Example AT+QSCLK=1 OK 6.3.
